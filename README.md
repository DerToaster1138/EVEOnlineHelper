# EVEOnlineHelper
Utility Library for the Video Game EVE Online by CCP Games.

Designed as a School/Hobby Project after EVEMarketeer went offline 2023 (sad noise)
Currently its a ***Console App***, but the Class Library is on its way to be usable in WinForms and/or other Programs that actually have a UI, for example D365 F&O

## Currently Implemented
- Marketscanner for the Major Tradehubs (Jita, Amarr, etc)
- TypeInformation Screen

## In Development:
- Integration of SQLite for saving Marketdata

## Next on the Roadmap
- Information Screen filtering for Systems Stations and Corperations.
- Market and Structure based prognosis of Item Production (if you buy 500k Megacyte, youll prob building a warship... digital footprint my ratting friends)
- Route Planning withing corps space

### And now: The Rant
This Project is a MASSIVE on and off project due to work, school, private stuff, and sometimes waiting on Pull Request Reviewers, so dont expect this to be done anytime soon in any meaninful state.

Personally im fine with this taking a bit more time, because to be frank **I can use this as an Apprenticeship Project**.

If you *somehow* find this Repo 1) congrats, how did you get here?? 2) dont worry, this is as confusing to you as it is to me 3) feedback welcome, even if its just shitposting about my Code Standards

TLDR;
This is just Madness that i randomly do
